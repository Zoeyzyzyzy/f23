Hi folks! My name is Yeganeh (feel free to call me Yegi), I'm a Ph.D. student in computer science with a focus on computer architecture. Before joining UCSB, I received my master's in computer engineering and worked independently on hardware security from a logic locking approach. I started learning programming languages seriously in the senior year of my bachelor's studies when I was a physics student. I enjoy coding with python as it's more of a language than a programming language to me! Please feel free to reach out for your questions during the office hours or in the course's online platform. I will try my best to answer your questions comprehensively.
