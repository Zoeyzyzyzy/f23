Hi, everyone! I am a third-year undergrad student in the CS major. I love working with computers and helping others with software or hardware problems. It's my great pleasure to help you with any course-related materials. I developed web apps as my hobby and greatly enjoyed working with Linux servers (so please feel free to ask me any questions regarding programming or using Linux systems). Looking forward to meeting you all!
