Hey CMPSC 16 students! My name is Edward and I'm a second year Computer Engineering student from Pleasanton, CA in the San Francisco Bay Area. I was first introduced to programming from my involvement in robotics in high school (go AVBotz!) and I've never really stopped coding since. In my free time, I like to stay up to date on current events, cook for my family and listen to indie music. I'm also a huge data nerd; some of my past hobby projects have included elections modeling/mapping and data visualization. Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about anything at all - I love to meet new people. I'm really excited to serve as one of your ULAs this quarter.
