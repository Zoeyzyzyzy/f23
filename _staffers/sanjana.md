Hi everyone! My name is Sanjana Shankar and I am a third year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science! This will be my first time being a ULA for a CS course in person and I am so excited to work with all of you and guide you all while you guys begin your journey in your computer science careers! I remember programming being really overwhelming when I first started coding in middle school but I will be there to provide you guys with some tips and tricks to make sure C++ becomes a language that you all will become comfortable programming in. Fun fact: My favorite programming language when I was a freshman at UCSB was C++ but now it has recently changed to Python! Please feel free to reach out to ask me questions about anything! I am looking forward to meeting you all and working with you all during this quarter!
