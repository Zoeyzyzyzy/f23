Hello, students! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the CS department. My main research area is machine learning for natural language processing. I had industrial experience before starting my Ph.D. study. I started learning how to program when I was an elementary school student, and I am still learning. :)

I am happy to take any questions or concerns you may have while taking this course, so feel free to contact me if you need any help. I will try my best to assist you together with the instructor and other TAs to learn as much as possible through the course.
