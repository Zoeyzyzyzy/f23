Hi, I'm Jacky, a second-year M.S. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializing in communication and robotics. My programming experience dates back to my freshman year for embedded system design. Even though coming from a different background, I believe it gives me a unique perspective on programming and algorithm analysis.
I'm excited to be a TA for this course and more than happy to answer your questions and concerns regarding it. Feel free to contact me via email or Piazza at any time. I'm looking forward to meeting with all of you.
