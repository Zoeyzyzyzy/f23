Hi all! I'm a third year CS student from SoCal. Though this is my first time ULAing for a class, I have lots of experience teaching computer science to primary and secondary school kids, so I'll try my best to help everyone succeed. I enjoy snowboarding and discovering music in my free time, so whether you'd like to talk about those or ask any questions related to the course, don't hesitate to reach out! Looking forward to assisting you all.
